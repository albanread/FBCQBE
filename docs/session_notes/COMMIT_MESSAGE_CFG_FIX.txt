Fix: Recursive CFG processing for nested control-flow in IF statements

PROBLEM:
WHILE and FOR loops nested inside multi-line IF statements only
executed one iteration instead of looping correctly. The CFG builder
was not recursively processing nested control-flow statements.

ROOT CAUSE:
Multi-line IF statements store their bodies as child nodes
(thenStatements, elseStatements, elseIfClauses) in the AST. The CFG
builder only processed top-level sequential statements and never
recursively descended into IF statement bodies.

SOLUTION:
- Added processNestedStatements() helper method to recursively process
  statements inside IF blocks
- Modified processIfStatement() to call processNestedStatements() for
  THEN, ELSEIF, and ELSE branches
- Handles all control-flow statement types (WHILE, FOR, DO, REPEAT, IF,
  GOTO, GOSUB, CASE, TRY/CATCH, labels)
- Avoids double-processing by adding non-control-flow statements directly
  to blocks

CHANGES:
- fsh/FasterBASICT/src/fasterbasic_cfg.cpp: Added processNestedStatements()
  method and modified processIfStatement()
- fsh/FasterBASICT/src/fasterbasic_cfg.h: Added method declaration
- test_basic_suite.sh: Added CFG test section
- tests/test_while_if_nested.bas: New test case
- tests/test_for_if_nested.bas: New test case
- NESTED_WHILE_IF_BUG.md: Updated status to FIXED
- NESTED_WHILE_IF_FIX_SUMMARY.md: Detailed fix documentation
- CFG_FIX_SESSION_COMPLETE.md: Complete session summary

TESTING:
✅ test_while_if_nested.bas - WHILE inside IF works correctly
✅ test_for_if_nested.bas - FOR inside IF works correctly
✅ test_while_nested_simple.bas - No regression in simple nesting
✅ test_primes_sieve.bas - Real-world algorithm works
✅ All core tests pass (no regressions)

IMPACT:
- Enables correct execution of nested control structures
- Fixes prime sieve and similar algorithms
- No breaking changes
- Minimal performance impact (compile-time only)

Fixes: Nested WHILE-in-IF bug
